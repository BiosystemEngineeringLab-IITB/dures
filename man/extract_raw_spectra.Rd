\usage{
extract_raw_spectra(
  folder_path,
  list_of_spectra_files,
  intrascan_grouping_tolerance = 0.05,
  top_percent_tic = 0.8
)
}
\arguments{
\item{folder_path:}{same folder path used in preprocess(). The extracted fragment-grouped spectra in .txt format will be stored here}

\item{list_of_spectra_files:}{output from preprocess()}

\item{intrascan_grouping_tolerance:}{if fragments are found within this mass tolerance (in Da), they will be grouped into a single fragment by taking average mz value and sum of intensities. Default value is 0.05 Da.}

\item{top_percent_tic:}{this parameter will tell the user that only top x\% TIC spectra will be extracted and stored in the folder in .txt format. Default value is 0.8 (or 80\%)}
}
\value{
a list containing all top x\% TIC scans in spectra format, a dataframe showing the number of spectra remaining before and after applying the top x\% cutoff, and a vector containing features with no fragments
}
\description{
Extracts MS2 spectra for every feature, groups fragments within a given mass tolerance and store only the top x\% TIC spectra for further analysis. It is required to run preprocess() before running this.
